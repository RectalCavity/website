# Cruz is the name
GirHub practice
This is Cruz with some information on Cruz and his purpose here. 
He is trying to learn as much about programming as possible. He did find himself to really enjoy website desiging and writing HTML and CSS. I guess it's the art side of him... Anyways, he is currently unable to attend school and earn his degree in Computer Science right now so, he's trying to learn as much as possible from what he can. LinkedIn being the main source.
